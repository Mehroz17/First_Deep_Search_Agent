<p align="center">
  🚀 An advanced orchestration system for managing and coordinating multiple AI agents in deep research tasks.
</p>

---

## 📖 Overview
Deep Search Orchestration Agent is designed to streamline **multi-agent collaboration** for research and information retrieval.  
It enables complex queries to be broken down, searched, synthesized, and reported through a coordinated set of specialized agents.

---

## 🧠 Agents Used

- **🔹 Lead Search Agent (Orchestrator)**  
  Manages overall workflow and coordinates other agents.  

- **🔹 Planning Agent**  
  Breaks down complex queries into smaller, simple sub-queries.  

- **🔹 Deep Search Agent**  
  Executes web searches for each sub-query generated by the Planning Agent.  

- **🔹 Synthesis Agent**  
  Analyzes and generates insights from the collected search results.  

- **🔹 Report Agent**  
  Produces a comprehensive report from the synthesized insights.
